Let's do some CEP assignments 

To be used for every single assignment.
A.	Use GitHub/GitLab for version control
B.	Follow the GitFlow methodology with small and consistent commits 

MVVM Design architecture
a.	Create an app which displays Hello World on the screen.
b.	Take the previous app and add a feature which displays list of accounts in a table view. Data is in the JSON file (Accounts.json).
c.	Take the previous app and change static JSON data to load data from a REST API. You can use jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to create a temporary static API without any coding and any server.
d.	Take the previous app and add a feature when user taps on any account, show the details (opening date, transactions etc) of the account on a new screen. You can use JSON Placeholder APIs to create a new API for list of transactions.

Going forward, I'm going to ask you drop in this chat your stand-up notes
This should be sent every day (then you begin working) it should be in the following format:
- What you achieved on the previous (working) day 
- What you plan to achieve that day
- Any blockers you encountered
